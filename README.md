# ML number guessing
Started with a discussion in math class, ended with my afternoon and evening being spent making a number guesser.

Not the greatest code, most is undocumented as I often do not write comments when I'm suuuper focused. I'll add more comments when I finish everything up.

This uses *primarily* Q-Learning with epsilon decay, but I'll implement a few more algorithms/models soon.

Feel free to open an issue or PR.
